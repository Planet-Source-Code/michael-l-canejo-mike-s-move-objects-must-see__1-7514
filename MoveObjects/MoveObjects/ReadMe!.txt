'
'   Thanks for downloading my Move objects
'example. First I'd like to say...this is a
'long piece of coding if you noticed. So
'I recommend you use Arrays if your planning
'on doing something like this. I tried to use
'arrays but I quit after I finished half of this
'project and re-written it all over. (Problems with PointAPI)
'Anyway, here is my example. It lets you Add objects
'to the form and lets the User move the object anywhere
'on the form, I also made it so that they couldn't move
'the object off of the form. You can also Rename or Delete
'the object by Right Clicking them. And the hardest part of this
'Was being able to detect and Save all of the open Objects
'I mean..the object's position, caption and if it's visible
'And then be able to load all that Info on each object!
'Well here is my loooong project. But it's a perfect example
'For you programmers who want to make a program that lets
'The user move objects around on the Form.
'
'Here's an example on how this is useful..
'
'Visual HTML making programs...Like FrontPage or
'Macromedia DreamWeaver...They let the user add objects
'and lets them move it around. (Input Button, Option Button..Checkbutton...etc.)
'Well you could also use a PictureBox and insert a Picture into it so
'you can create different looking objects to move...

'Well here is my project, thanks for reading this And
'I hope You find this usefull.. If you do please
'E-mail me at: Mike@dev-center.com
'AIM: Mike3dd
'Because to know that somebody likes
'what I create is cool... You know?

'And also RATE this Please..I spent
'long Hours making this so take the time
'To rate it. Thanks Again....
